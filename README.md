✨ About Me
I’m Yadesa Mulugeta, a Software Engineering student passionate about mobile app development using Flutter, exploring web technologies, and building projects with Python.

I previously had a GitHub account that contained many of my CS50 Harvard projects and Python apps (including a checkers game), but I lost access due to 2FA (two-factor authentication) issues.
Now, with my new GitHub account, I’m continuing to grow, rebuild, and share my learning journey.
